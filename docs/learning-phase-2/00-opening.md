## 0.2 Today's Goals

Bubble is a no-code tool that allows you to build applications through intuitive visual operations. It’s a powerful tool for developing prototype or relatively simple applications quickly and cost-effectively.

However, when it comes to meeting more complex requirements, the functions provided by Bubble alone become insufficient. In such cases, by writing code yourself and developing through programming languages, you can implement more advanced and detailed features.

In this and the following two sessions, we will learn how to develop applications by writing programming code. In this first session, we’ll cover the fundamental concepts, tools, and basic syntax needed for web application development. In the upcoming sessions, we’ll move on to more advanced development topics.

By the end of this workshop, you will:

1. **Understand web applications** - Learn how websites and web apps work behind the scenes
2. **Set up your development environment** - Install and configure all the tools professional developers use
3. **Write your first code** - Create a functional Pet Management application
4. **Learn programming fundamentals** - Variables, functions, conditionals, loops, and more
5. **Experience team development** - Use Git and GitHub like professional developers do

## 0.4 Learning Approach

This workshop is **hands-on and practical**:

### We Learn By Doing
- ❌ Not just lectures and slides
- ✅ Real coding exercises
- ✅ Building actual applications
- ✅ Immediate feedback

### Progressive Learning
```
Simple concepts → Practice → Build on previous knowledge → More practice → Complete application
```

### Support System
1. **Try it yourself** first
2. **Discuss with neighbors** if stuck
3. **Raise your hand** for instructor help
4. **Review materials** in the documentation

## 0.5 Ground Rules

### For the Best Learning Experience

1. **Ask Questions**
   - There are no stupid questions
   - If you're confused, others probably are too
   - Asking helps everyone learn

2. **Help Each Other**
   - Discuss with your neighbors
   - Share solutions and ideas
   - Teaching others reinforces your learning

3. **Focus on Understanding**
   - Don't rush to finish first
   - It's okay to be slower if you understand better
   - Depth over speed

4. **Have Fun!**
   - Programming is creative
   - Building things is satisfying
   - Enjoy the process
